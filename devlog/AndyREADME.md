# My Devlog

# Overview
Hello my name Andy and I will be attempting the technical assessment for the SecurEd Junior Software Developer position. As a prefice, I don't have much or any experience with Node, Express, or web APIs just the basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge. However, I was always interested in web development so I feel this would give me a better understanding of what that process is like and whether if I do get the position or not at least I know what I need to work on for next time around. Hope for the best!

# Deciding which tasks to work on 
I wanted to look over both the frontend and backend folders to see which combination of tasks I should work on. The idea is figuring out which set of tasks would be "easier" to do research on since this is due within 2 weeks. For the frontend, I would need some coverage on Angular 2+, NodeJS, and a Typescript. While for the backend, I would need to work on Node, Express, and use Postman to test out the API. So for my attempt, I will try to work on all 4 backend tasks and with extra time try some frontend tasks. Angular 2+ seems like a lot to learn and with limited amount of time it can be challenging.

# Day 1: Setting my environment up
I went over the read.me and downloaded all the required applications I need to start on the backend which are VSCode as my text editor, NodeJS, and Postman to test out the API.

# Day 2: Looking up videos for research
I was looking around on Youtube and discovered Dave Gray's video on NodeJS and Express
